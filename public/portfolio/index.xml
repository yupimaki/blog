TL;DR  Clone this repo to get the necessary files Install terraform cd into netflix-and-socks repo Copy and fill in secrets/terraform.tfvars.template as secrets/terraform.tfvars Run terraform init Run ./terraform.sh apply and type yes to confirm Run ./launch.sh to avoid geofencing.  If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with AWS (Amazon Web Services), this is all you need to do, hence it is super easy and convienient.</description>

      <description>After having deployed a few websites with Nginx and understanding how to use it fairly well, I thought it might be useful to ask a question to my colleague Vergil which he found pretty funny.
 &amp;lsquo;So&amp;hellip; what actually is a webserver?&amp;rsquo;
 I&amp;rsquo;ve found with a few programs with especially clean interfaces (such as git), I end up being able to use a program effectively without understanding it, so I can mindlessly follow instructures and proceedures I&amp;rsquo;ve done before, but I can&amp;rsquo;t create anything.</description>

      <description>Let’s try and find out for ourselves just how much Facebook knows about me, given I waived my privacy to them back in 2009. If you download your own through settings on your profile and have some familiarity with R, you should be able to run the same graphs off from your own data. The markdown file is available on my github page and there’s a code dump as the appendix.</description>
